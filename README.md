# SLITHER
## Description
Welcome to Slither, the next up-in-coming trend in social networking!

While it doesn't look like much, Slither aims to provide a new set of features
never before seen in the common grounds of social networking. This time, in Slither,
you will experience the _mashup_ of the century!

Slither takes Snake, one of the biggest games of the mobile revolution, and combines
it with your normal Twitter or Facebook feeds to give you what you want most in
your circle of friends: To know that, out of all your friends, you are the very
**BEST** at Snake!

Never got into the original Snake? Slither is also for you! Slither can open up
a world of improvement for both veterans and n00bies. With our specialized stat
tracking manager, you can keep track of your improvement, and in the future,
even watch past replays of yours and your friends to learn from all your mistakes
or your biggest rivals!

Stop living in the past, and join the rest of your friends on Slither!
