### Snake
The implementation of Snake will be very similar to the classic addition seen in
most phone libraries. The player controls a constantly-moving snake and must collect
the "dots" in the arena without colliding with a segment of themselves nor the walls
of the arena. With every dot that is collected, the player grows in length.
The goal of the game is to achieve the highest score.

#### Point Scoring
Points are accumulated over time. A multiplier is applied to the score with every
dot that is collected the multiplier is increased. The player is also given a small
bonus (after the multiplier has been applied) for collecting a dot. If the player
is able to fill the arena (this inevitably losing), they will be given a small bonus,
plus a star marked on their name. After the game is complete, other factors such as
number of turns, most efficient routes, etc will be taken into account to produce
a final, ranked score.

## Tools, Languages, and Libraries!
Slither is primarily written in Ruby with Ruby on Rails. "Snake" itself will be
written in JavaScript using the HTML Canvas with other HTML5 support. Other obvious
tools will be CSS and HTML. Ajax and jQuery will both be used to provide an interactive
experience with the website.
